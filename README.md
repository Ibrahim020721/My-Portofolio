## About me

I am an optimistic individual with a balanced set of strengths. My background as a Quality Assurance professional has honed my skills in organization, precision, and attention to detail. At the same time, my communicative nature and problem-solving mindset enable me to effectively collaborate with teams and ensure the delivery of high-quality solutions.

I got my Bachelor Degree from the Universitas Bina Sarana Informatika and during my studies I had experience as a Quality Assurance at PT Bluebird Group TBK for 2 years with the MyBluebird (MyBB) product, which involved making test plans to making test result reports.

And the following is the complete portfolio and data that I have included
